	 * Writes a look-up table into FLASH memory, in order to calibrate and linearize deflection sensor.
	 * Look-up table is written into FLASH to prevent it from getting deleted on reset.
	 * PA0 is used to send pulse signals to stepper motor, which drives a linear actuator to press onto deflection sensor.
	 * To prevent issues with mechanical back-lash in the actuator, the system is set to only drive the stepper in one direction.
	 * After the initial data collection, a second while loop corrects for the initial error.
	 * The initial error is caused by not knowing when contact is established - interpolation between points displace all data points,
	 * to correct for this error.
